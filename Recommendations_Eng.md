# Recommendations

### 1. UX & Website Optimization

- **Do not change the Checkout Flow:** The conversion rates from Checkout Start $|to$ Purchase are excellent (~ 80%+). This indicates the technical payment flow is frictionless.
    - Action: Do not redesign the checkout page right now; you risk breaking something that is working perfectly.

### 2. Marketing Strategy

- **Stop Over-Investing in Social for Sales:** Social Media is driving 30% of traffic (Volume) but has the lowest conversion rate (Efficiency). Spending on social media attracts “window shoppers” who do not make any purchases but increase brand awareness.
    - Action: Shift budget away from “Traffic” objectives on social ads and focus on “Retargeting” or “Lead Gen” to capture emails instead.
- **Double Down on Email Marketing:** Email is highest converting channel (~13%+ conversion rate vs ~6% for Social)
    - Action: Implement a strategy to collect email addresses (e.g., via a pop-up window on the website) from users coming from social media.

### 3. Financial & Revenue

- Audit Ad Spend against AOV: It was discovered that the Average order Value is ~ 115$.
    - Action: Set a strict Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) limit. Exceeding the break-even point of $30–40 to acquire a customer through social media advertising (which has the lowest conversion rate) results in a negative margin on those specific transactions.
